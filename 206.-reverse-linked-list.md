# 206. Reverse Linked List

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

## My Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseList = function(head) {
    if(!head){
        return null;
    }
    if(!head.next){
        return head
    }
    // change the dirction of the pointers pairs by pairs
    // first and second indicate the target of the changing pair
    let first = head;
    let second = head.next;
    
    while(second){
        const temp = second.next;    //(1)
        second.next = first;        //(2)
        first = second;            //(3)
        second = temp;            //(3)
    }
    head.next = null;            //(4)
    return first
};
```

This is a classic problem. In this problem, we do in-place method. We manipulate the reverse by changing the direction of the pointers pairs by pairs.   
1. we memorize the non-influence part.  
2. we cut the changing pair from the non-influence part and build a new pointer from the second element of the pair points to the first element of the pair in the same time.  
3. move our target element and connect to the non-influence part.  
4. remember that the original first element is still point to the original second element \(since we start from cutting the  changing pair from the non-influence part @step2\)
