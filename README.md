# About this gitbook

In this book, I record the problems that I have solved in leetcode by Javascript.

For each problem, I screenshot the problem description, analyze the problem if needed and provide my code. Also, interesting solutions from other submissions and useful resources are provided.

This is an open source gitbook.

Please contact me if I mistakenly offend your intellectual property rights.
