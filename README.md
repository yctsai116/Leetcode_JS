# About this gitbook

In this book, I record the problems that I have solved in leetcode by Javascript.

For each problem, I screenshot the problem description, provide my code and some resources. Also, some interesting solutions from other submissions are provided.

This is an open source gitbook. 

Please contact me if I mistakenly offend your intellectual property rights.
