# 53\*. Maximum Subarray

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)

## Analysis

This is not a problem that is so easy to find a good solution at the first time. In this problem we use dynamic programming to solve the method. We divide our problem into small problems and find the solution of the small problem and evolve to solve the big problem.

### Here is the analysis of the problem:

1. If the array has only one element, then the contiguous sub-array \(containing at least one number\) which has the largest sum is the only element.
2.  If we know the answer of the max sum of  the contiguous sub-array between the 1-st element to the \(i-1\)-th element , can we refer to the answer of the 1-st element to the i-th element?
3. We should consider two scenario:
   1. The max sum of the sub-array that contains the current element, which is i-th element. \(This means the sub-array is still developing, might be better or worse\).
   2. The max sum of the sub-array so far \( maybe include or not include the i-th element \). \(This means the best answer so far\)

## My Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSubArray = function(nums) {
    let curr = nums[0];
    let res = nums[0];
    for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
        curr = Math.max(curr+nums[i],nums[i])
        res = Math.max(curr,res)
    }
    return res
};
```
