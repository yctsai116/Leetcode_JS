# 371. Sum of Two Integers

## Analysis

It is not hard to think of using binary to solve this problem, but the logic of sum is quite difficult to implement. 

## My Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @return {number}
 */
var getSum = function(a, b) {
    var carry = (a&b);
    var ans = (a|b);
    // if (carry&ans) exist, which means the summation has carry issue.
    while(carry&ans){
        let old_ans=ans;
        // handle the current carry issue
        ans = (old_ans^carry) | (carry<<1);
        // new carry
        carry = (old_ans^carry) & (carry<<1);
    }
    return ans
};
```

## Solution 1

```javascript
var getSum = function(a, b) {
   
   while (b!=0) {
        let temp = (a&b)<<1;   
        a = a ^ b;
        b = temp;   
   }
    
   return a; 
};
```

It is easier to understand than my code, but takes more time to run since it remove the carry bit all the way to the left side of 32 bits.
